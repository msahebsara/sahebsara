    "Currently a Software Developer @ Intuit. Computing Science specialization graduate from the University of Alberta. I like to build and optimize full-stack applications, with a recent interest in LLMs and serverless computing. I built this website with Next.js and Tailwind and deployed it with Vercel, to learn more about these cool new technologies. In my free time, I enjoy cycling, playing chess, and discovering new music.",
